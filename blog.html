                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we expanded our command line chops with some Node.js.  Up to this point, I've been farily familiar with what's been going on in class (with the excpetion of <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>), but this new venture into Node.js is completely new territory for me, which is exciting.  I'm happy to be growing as a developer and getting into areas with which I'm unfamiliar.  That's something that, as a self-taught coder, wouldn't be impossible, but would be much more difficult, especially knowing how to progress through new technologies, what builds off what, etc.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We did a lot of work with the<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Node Package Manager</a> which is a very powerful tool for getting data.  It seems pretty similar to using an API to get data (and maybe it is essentially the same thing), but just with a different approach.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">The specific packages we worked with this week were 'fs', which lets you access the File System on your local machine and perform a multitude of actions; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request" target="_blank">request</a>, which lets you make API calls with a query URL and parameters, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/geocoder">geocoder</a>, which lets you pass in various parameters (city name, coordinates, etc.) and get data back (which seems like it could work very well with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/" target="_blank">Google Maps Embed API</a>; and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">inquirer</a>, which gives you more control over the command line interface.</p>
                    <p>All in all, this was a great week and I'm very happy to have added Node.js to my developer's toolkit.</p>

                    <p class="blog-content">We presented our group project today!  I was pretty happy with our final product and am definitely proud of what we accoplished, but there were some other projects that were really good.  (It's tough not to compare yourself to your classmates; no matter how hard I try to keep my head down and focus on myself and my process, I still do it from time to time.)  As a teacher, I've had plenty of experience speaking in front of people, both students everyday and parents on meet-the-teacher night, but this was a different beast.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">Everyone was super positive and uplifting in the room for every project presented, but there's that feeling of "I wonder if they think this is s#%t...".  Lol...human nature I guess, right?</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">All in all, this was a great process to go through and I know I'm a better coder, team member, and person because of it.  Looking forward to the next one!</p>

                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we got to take a break from learning all new things and work with some classmates on a group project.  I'm really excited about this project for many reasons.  First and foremost, we get to go back and review all those concepts and technologies we've used thus far and really get to implement them in any way we want.  That's both exciting and scary all at the same time (which is the way most great things are; exciting and scary, in a good way).  Second, I really feel that the group setting is going to give us a good glimpse into a real-life working environment.  Almost any developer you talk to these days will say that he/she is part of a team; there seem to be fewer lone-wolf coders out there anymore.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">I'm really happy with my team.  I think we're going to work great together.  We've divied up the roles and I will be working on the behind-the-scenes features, specifically selecting which APIs to use and how to use them.  I'm also really happy with our product choice.  We're going to be making PickUp, which is an app that lets users either create or find pick up games for various sports.  So far, we're thinking <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/" target="_blank">Google Maps Embed API</a> (there are quite a few different Google Maps APIs) and <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/" target="_blank">Weather Underground</a>.  These both serve really relevant purposes for our app and we're feeling pretty confident about their contribution to adding useful features for the user.</p>

                    <h3>Week 7 - Firebase<small>6/4/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we ventured into using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to persistently store data.  This was a pretty great jump in terms of creating websites that can have a life cycle longer than just the user's initial interaction with them (i.e. the games and apps that we created leading up to this week).</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We used jQuery to capture user input from a form, and then implemented the <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> object to post that data to <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>.  So as I can gather at this point, <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> is basically like 'server as a service', which allows easy storage of data to be used, appended to, referenced, and so on over time.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">One interesting challenge we solved this week was how to calculate the amount of time remaining before the arrival of a train, based on the frequency of the train and the current time.  To help with this task, we learned about and used <a href="http://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment.js</a>, a great JS library for working with time.  It allows for so many options in terms of how to display the time, how to help calculate time, etc.  If you're looking for a resource to use for any time-related issues, I'd highly recommend it.</p>

                    <h3>Week 6 - AJAX &amp; APIs<small>5/28/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we ventured into making AJAX calls to APIs using jQuery's <code>$.ajax</code> functionality, specifically the <code>'POST'</code> method.  During my self study, I had never really moved past creating something and putting it out there for people to see, and this was my first exposure to requesting data and getting a response.  The JSON data that came bac kat first was intimidating, particularily in figuring out how to traverse it and get at what you need.  When objects are nested inside of arrays, which are nested inside other arrays, and all part of an object, you've really got to do some detective work to get the specific category of data you need.  Your code ends up looking something like:</p>
                    <p class="blog-content"><code>var movieTitle = response.data[0].info.movie.title[0];</code>
                    <p class="blog-content">To make things easier, enter <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman.</a>  Using this app, you can get a much better view of the data structure and even paste in the query URLs to check out the data before you try to impliment it into your own app.  It's super useful and I recommend it to any developer getting started with making API calls.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also delved pretty deep into using <code>data</code> attributes in our DOM elements to help control their state.  It seems like these are some pretty important and very useful properties for controlling elements.  I'm going to read more about the <code>aria</code> attributes I've seen before because they seem pretty similar.</p>

                    <h3>Week 5 - Review, Interview Q's, AJAX<small>5/21/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we reviewed the concepts that we've studied so far, including basic stuff about HTML, CSS, and JS.  This was a welcome little break from the onslaught of information presented to us in the past 4 weeks.  For me personally, this is good timing because the school year is coming to an end and I have a lot of stuff to do to get ready for the final exams.  But...almost there!  Almost to the point where I'll be able to focus 100% of my efforts on deeper study of the concepts covered in class and start working on side projects!</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">On day 1 of this week, we were placed into 3 groups, and it was seemingly based on thus-far performance in the class.  My group was tasked with making a jQuery Simon Says game, which proved to be pretty difficult actually.  The students designing the game board itself did a great job with the 4 colored divs (I believe they used the 'border-radius' properties in CSS to achieve the rounded shape) and the rest of us were tasked with writing the game logic.  Tracking the progress of selection, checking for correctness, then branching from there based on right or wrong was tough.  We got pretty close, but had to move on to the next thing.  It was fun to work with the other people in the group and bounce ideas off each other and expand on each other's ideas.  I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of the task.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">The interview questions from this week were...tough.  It's these types of questions that make me nervous when job-hunting time begins.  They're so abstract...so higher-order...so tricky that it's really intimidating.  But the good news is that word on the street is that companies are moving away from these types of questions because they don't actually provide a good screening tool.  I'm sure that's not the case for a lot of companies; I'm sure many of them still use them, and will continue to do so.  But in my opinion, being able to solve a super tricky, super high-level algorithmic puzzle (especially at this early point in my web dev track) doesn't give a true picture of who I am as an employee:  easy to work with, people person, hard worker, not afraid to try new things and fail for the sake of learning.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also got a quick introduction to making AJAX calls, but I believe there's much more to come on this front next week.</p>

                    <h3>Week 4 - jQuery<small>5/14/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we learned about jQuery, Javascript's favorite offshoot.  I really enjoyed this week; jQuery makes writing seemingly complicated things in Javascript muuuuuuch easier.  Instead of a bunch of 'document.getElementById()' statements, you can simply use jQuery's 'bling' ($) operator to select elements with a certain class or id.  So '$(.nav-link).on("click", function() etc..." will select all elements with the class 'nav-link' and listen for a click event.  Whoa.  Super simple; super useful; and it really made me feel like I had much more control over my document, and therefore my overall application.  I.  Love.  jQuery.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content"><span class="callout">nb:</span> It's always a good idea to include the following code at the beginning of your document:
                    <br><pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
   // stuff 
 }</code></pre></p>
                    <p class="blog-content">The reason it's a good idea to include the above code is because you want the document (aka the DOM) to be fully loaded before your user starts interacting with it.  If not, some odd things could possibly happen.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about the concept of 'scope'.  This is very important when writing Javascript because it affects how data stored in variables can be used throughout the process.  Basically, any variable declared <span class="callout">inside</span> a function can only be used inside that function, and all other areas <span class="callout">outside</span> of that function.  In other words, the scope of a variable can bubble out, but not in.  There is a great article <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/10/20/javascript-scope-closures/" target="_blank">here</a> that explains scoping much better than I can at this point.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we jumped into learning about Javascript.  Once again, a lot of the information we covered this week I had already learned in my self-study.  But it was nice to hear an industry professional's take on the usefulness of Javascript and how he approaches it.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We learned about variables (like 'nouns' in JS), functions (like 'verbs'), arrays (a collection of data), objects (a more verbose 'noun' with properties and values), and manipulating the DOM (aka the Document Object Model...the elements that usually live in index.html [or whatever other .html doc]).  JS makes up 1/3 of the all important trio - HTML, CSS, JS.  HTML gives structure to the page; CSS makes the page look "pretty"; and JS makes the page do stuff (aka allows the user to interact with the page).</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">According to my web developer friends, JS is the most important, core language with which to become familiar.  So many other things are predicated on an understanding of JS.  It's definitely a beast, but I'm excited to learn more and get better.  It will take time, but it can be done.</p>

                    <h3>Week 2 - Heroku, More CSS, Bootstrap<small>4/30/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we learned about the hosting site <a href="http://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku </a>, which is a great way to publish your sites live on the internet.  The site itself is designed for dynamic websites (which, we don't know any PHP yet), so our instructors helped us include two files which sort of 'hacks' Heroku to allow hosting of static sites.  I believe this is how we'll be turning in our homework assignments from now on.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about the framework <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which was created by &copy;Twitter.  It's a very powerful and easy to use framework for HTML, CSS, and even some JS functionality.  It puts mobile-responsiveness first, which is important in modern web trends because so many people access sites through their small devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.).  With the framework, all you have to do is add classes to DOM elements to make them appear correctly and respond in certain ways when resizing the screen (much easier than writing your own @media queries!).  The basic flow for a Bootstrap site is:  1) container; 2) row; 3) column.  Following this pattern, it's pretty easy to layout your content correctly.  One <span class="callout">super important step</span> when beginning to develop any project is to work out a wireframe and to do a sketch.  This will help visualize how the site will look on the screen.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">Our homework assignments this week were to create two portfolio sites, one using basic HTML and CSS, and one using a Bootstrap theme.  The latter seems a bit like cheating, but I suppose it's a quick and easy way to get a site live on the web on which you can host your other projects.  I think I'll follow this route in the future.</p>

                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">Here we go; first week of class is in the books!  A lot of the things we learned in class this week I had already learned through self-study.  One thing that was new and definitely valuable was learning some very basic command line commands, like 'pwd' for 'present working directory' (aka to see where you are in the terminal); 'cd' for 'change directory' to move around in the terminal; 'ls' for 'list' to see a list of files and directories in the current directory; 'touch' (which is a strange command word choice) for creating new files; 'mkdir' for 'make directory' to create a directory (or folder); 'rm' for 'remove' to delete a file (and, subsequently, 'rmdir' for 'remove directory' to delete a directory).  All this was very new and welcome information.  It really makes you feel like you know what you're doing when you use the command line to execute even simple tasks like the ones above.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about Git and GitHub this week and the <span class="callout">very important, fundamental</span> concept that Git &ne; GitHub.  Git is a mysterious program used in the termial for version control (which, at this point...whatever that means, lol).  GitHub is where you store your code online...using Git to push the code to GitHub.  Yeah.  It's confusing.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about the basic structure of an HTML document and some important CSS, including the box-model.  Our TA, Holly, kept talking about 'Flexbox' in CSS, which sounds pretty cool and useful.  I'll have to go back and read about that.  One extremely helpful thing I learned about CSS this week is that when you set the property 'box-sizing: border-box', you can then mainpulate the 'padding', aka the space between the content and the edge of the box, and it will not make the box bigger.
