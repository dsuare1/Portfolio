                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we reviewed the concepts that we've studied so far, including basic stuff about HTML, CSS, and JS.  This was a welcome little break from the onslaught of information presented to us in the past 4 weeks.  For me personally, this is good timing because the school year is coming to an end and I have a lot of stuff to do to get ready for the final exams.  But...almost there!  Almost to the point where I'll be able to focus 100% of my efforts on deeper study of the concepts covered in class and start working on side projects!</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">On day 1 of this week, we were placed into 3 groups, and it was seemingly based on thus-far performance in the class.  My group was tasked with making a jQuery Simon Says game, which proved to be pretty difficult actually.  The students designing the game board itself did a great job with the 4 colored divs (I believe they used the 'border-radius' properties in CSS to achieve the rounded shape) and the rest of us were tasked with writing the game logic.  Tracking the progress of selection, checking for correctness, then branching from there based on right or wrong was tough.  We got pretty close, but had to move on to the next thing.  It was fun to work with the other people in the group and bounce ideas off each other and expand on each other's ideas.  I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of the task.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">The interview questions from this week were...tough.  It's these types of questions that make me nervous when job-hunting time begins.  They're so abstract...so higher-order...so tricky that it's really intimidating.  But the good news is that word on the street is that companies are moving away from these types of questions because they don't actually provide a good screening tool.  I'm sure that's not the case for a lot of companies; I'm sure many of them still use them, and will continue to do so.  But in my opinion, being able to solve a super tricky, super high-level algorithmic puzzle (especially at this early point in my web dev track) doesn't give a true picture of who I am as an employee:  easy to work with, people person, hard worker, not afraid to try new things and fail for the sake of learning.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also got a quick introduction to making AJAX calls, but I believe there's much more to come on this front next week.</p>

                    <h3>Week 4 - jQuery<small>5/14/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we learned about jQuery, Javascript's favorite offshoot.  I really enjoyed this week; jQuery makes writing seemingly complicated things in Javascript muuuuuuch easier.  Instead of a bunch of 'document.getElementById()' statements, you can simply use jQuery's 'bling' ($) operator to select elements with a certain class or id.  So '$(.nav-link).on("click", function() etc..." will select all elements with the class 'nav-link' and listen for a click event.  Whoa.  Super simple; super useful; and it really made me feel like I had much more control over my document, and therefore my overall application.  I.  Love.  jQuery.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content"><span class="callout">nb:</span> It's always a good idea to include the following code at the beginning of your document:
                    <br><pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
   // stuff 
 }</code></pre></p>
                    <p class="blog-content">The reason it's a good idea to include the above code is because you want the document (aka the DOM) to be fully loaded before your user starts interacting with it.  If not, some odd things could possibly happen.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about the concept of 'scope'.  This is very important when writing Javascript because it affects how data stored in variables can be used throughout the process.  Basically, any variable declared <span class="callout">inside</span> a function can only be used inside that function, and all other areas <span class="callout">outside</span> of that function.  In other words, the scope of a variable can bubble out, but not in.  There is a great article <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/10/20/javascript-scope-closures/" target="_blank">here</a> that explains scoping much better than I can at this point.</p>

                    <h3>Week 3 - Javascript<small>5/7/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we jumped into learning about Javascript.  Once again, a lot of the information we covered this week I had already learned in my self-study.  But it was nice to hear an industry professional's take on the usefulness of Javascript and how he approaches it.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We learned about variables (like 'nouns' in JS), functions (like 'verbs'), arrays (a collection of data), objects (a more verbose 'noun' with properties and values), and manipulating the DOM (aka the Document Object Model...the elements that usually live in index.html [or whatever other .html doc]).  JS makes up 1/3 of the all important trio - HTML, CSS, JS.  HTML gives structure to the page; CSS makes the page look "pretty"; and JS makes the page do stuff (aka allows the user to interact with the page).</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">According to my web developer friends, JS is the most important, core language with which to become familiar.  So many other things are predicated on an understanding of JS.  It's definitely a beast, but I'm excited to learn more and get better.  It will take time, but it can be done.</p>

                    <h3>Week 2 - Heroku, More CSS, Bootstrap<small>4/30/2016</small></h3>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">This week we learned about the hosting site <a href="http://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku </a>, which is a great way to publish your sites live on the internet.  The site itself is designed for dynamic websites (which, we don't know any PHP yet), so our instructors helped us include two files which sort of 'hacks' Heroku to allow hosting of static sites.  I believe this is how we'll be turning in our homework assignments from now on.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about the framework <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which was created by &copy;Twitter.  It's a very powerful and easy to use framework for HTML, CSS, and even some JS functionality.  It puts mobile-responsiveness first, which is important in modern web trends because so many people access sites through their small devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.).  With the framework, all you have to do is add classes to DOM elements to make them appear correctly and respond in certain ways when resizing the screen (much easier than writing your own @media queries!).  The basic flow for a Bootstrap site is:  1) container; 2) row; 3) column.  Following this pattern, it's pretty easy to layout your content correctly.  One <span class="callout">super important step</span> when beginning to develop any project is to work out a wireframe and to do a sketch.  This will help visualize how the site will look on the screen.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">Our homework assignments this week were to create two portfolio sites, one using basic HTML and CSS, and one using a Bootstrap theme.  The latter seems a bit like cheating, but I suppose it's a quick and easy way to get a site live on the web on which you can host your other projects.  I think I'll follow this route in the future.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p class="blog-content">Here we go; first week of class is in the books!  A lot of the things we learned in class this week I had already learned through self-study.  One thing that was new and definitely valuable was learning some very basic command line commands, like 'pwd' for 'present working directory' (aka to see where you are in the terminal); 'cd' for 'change directory' to move around in the terminal; 'ls' for 'list' to see a list of files and directories in the current directory; 'touch' (which is a strange command word choice) for creating new files; 'mkdir' for 'make directory' to create a directory (or folder); 'rm' for 'remove' to delete a file (and, subsequently, 'rmdir' for 'remove directory' to delete a directory).  All this was very new and welcome information.  It really makes you feel like you know what you're doing when you use the command line to execute even simple tasks like the ones above.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about Git and GitHub this week and the <span class="callout">very important, fundamental</span> concept that Git &ne; GitHub.  Git is a mysterious program used in the termial for version control (which, at this point...whatever that means, lol).  GitHub is where you store your code online...using Git to push the code to GitHub.  Yeah.  It's confusing.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">We also learned about the basic structure of an HTML document and some important CSS, including the box-model.  Our TA, Holly, kept talking about 'Flexbox' in CSS, which sounds pretty cool and useful.  I'll have to go back and read about that.  One extremely helpful thing I learned about CSS this week is that when you set the property 'box-sizing: border-box', you can then mainpulate the 'padding', aka the space between the content and the edge of the box, and it will not make the box bigger.  Super helpful when trying to perfect layout.</p>
